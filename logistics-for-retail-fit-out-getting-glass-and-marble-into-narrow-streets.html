                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Logistics is the biggest risk in narrow‑street fit‑outs.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Glass and marble require specialized handling and timing.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Failure to plan access windows causes costly delays.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Luxury retail fit‑outs in Taormina face a simple reality: narrow streets and restricted access. Transporting glass, marble, and premium fixtures is not a standard delivery—it is a coordinated operation with strict time windows. The investor’s pain is delays and damages that destroy budgets. The solution is precise logistics planning, staged deliveries, and safe handling procedures.</p>

                    <h2>1. Access windows and permits</h2>
                    <p>Heavy deliveries are limited to short windows (often 06:00–09:30). Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>permit requests for temporary access and unloading;</li>
                        <li>time‑slot booking with suppliers and carriers;</li>
                        <li>street management plans for pedestrian safety;</li>
                        <li>coordination with neighboring businesses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without scheduled access, deliveries become impossible.</p>

                    <h2>2. Handling glass and marble safely</h2>
                    <p>Fragile materials need specialized handling. Operational actions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>use of A‑frames and protective packaging;</li>
                        <li>micro‑cranes or manual hoists for vertical moves;</li>
                        <li>pre‑fabrication to reduce cutting on site;</li>
                        <li>insurance coverage for transport risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Damage to premium materials is a direct financial loss.</p>

                    <h2>3. Staging and storage strategy</h2>
                    <p>Storage in narrow streets is minimal. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>off‑site staging near the center;</li>
                        <li>just‑in‑time deliveries synchronized with installation;</li>
                        <li>temporary protection of installed finishes;</li>
                        <li>clear pathways to avoid crowd congestion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Good staging reduces both cost and risk.</p>

                    <h2>4. Installation sequencing</h2>
                    <p>Sequencing must minimize re‑handling. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>install heavy items first (marble, glazing);</li>
                        <li>protect finishes before moving lighter elements;</li>
                        <li>coordinate MEP trades to avoid rework;</li>
                        <li>verify tolerances before final fixings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Poor sequencing increases breakage and delays.</p>

                    <h2>5. Cost control and risk management</h2>
                    <p>Logistics is a budget line, not a footnote. Control includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>separate BOQ items for logistics and handling;</li>
                        <li>buffer funds for breakage and re‑orders;</li>
                        <li>daily progress logs for deliveries and installs;</li>
                        <li>clear responsibilities across suppliers and contractors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Logistics discipline protects the opening date.</p>
                    <p>We often stage materials outside the historic core and use smaller vehicles for the last mile. This reduces risk of damage and avoids blocking pedestrian flows. It also allows deliveries to happen inside the permitted time window.</p>
                    <p>Glass panels require climate‑controlled storage and protective edges. A single scratch can force a full replacement, with lead times of weeks. Protective handling protocols are a direct cost‑saving measure.</p>
                    <p>Marble pieces should be cut and finished off‑site wherever possible. On‑site cutting is noisy, dusty, and often restricted. Prefabrication reduces risk and speeds installation.</p>
                    <p>We also recommend a delivery rehearsal for high‑value items, mapping turning paths, door clearances, and lift capacities. A failed delivery attempt costs both money and time.</p>
                    <p>Access windows are not only logistical; they are also a cost line. Overtime crews are often required to meet morning windows, which increases labor costs. We budget for these realities upfront.</p>
                    <p>Protection of existing facades is mandatory during deliveries. We install temporary edge guards and padding to avoid damage to heritage elements, which can trigger disputes and delays.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we coordinate with local police or municipal authorities when required for road closures. Without this, deliveries can be stopped mid‑operation.</p>
                    <p>We assign a logistics coordinator on delivery days to manage timing, safety, and sequence. Without this role, delays compound quickly in narrow streets.</p>
                    <p>Post‑delivery inspections are mandatory: catching chips or cracks immediately avoids disputes with suppliers and keeps the schedule moving.</p>
                    <p>Clear responsibility matrices prevent disputes between suppliers and installers when damage occurs.</p>
                    <p>Where possible, we schedule deliveries on consecutive days to avoid repeated permit requests and reduce administrative friction.</p>
