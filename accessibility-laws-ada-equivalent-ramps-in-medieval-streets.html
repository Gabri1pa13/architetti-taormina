                    <div class="exec-summary">
                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Accessibility compliance is a legal and commercial requirement.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Historic streets require creative, compliant solutions.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Detailed measurements prevent rejected permits.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Accessibility is not optional in modern retail. In medieval streets, the challenge is to comply without damaging heritage fabric. The investor’s pain is clear: non‑compliance blocks permits and limits the customer base. The solution is a technical accessibility plan, based on real dimensions, reversible solutions, and precise documentation.</p>

                    <h2>1. Measure real constraints</h2>
                    <p>Accessibility solutions must start with precise measurements. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>survey of entry height differences and sidewalk width;</li>
                        <li>assessment of turning radius inside the store;</li>
                        <li>evaluation of available ramp length for compliant slopes;</li>
                        <li>review of heritage constraints on the facade.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without exact measurements, solutions remain theoretical.</p>

                    <h2>2. Ramp solutions and slope compliance</h2>
                    <p>Ramps must respect slope limits and safety requirements. Operational actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>design of ramps with rest platforms where required;</li>
                        <li>anti‑slip surfaces compatible with historic materials;</li>
                        <li>discreet handrails integrated into the facade;</li>
                        <li>temporary or reversible solutions for protected facades.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Compliance is about function, not aesthetics alone.</p>

                    <h2>3. Alternative solutions when ramps are impossible</h2>
                    <p>When ramps cannot fit, alternative systems are needed. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>platform lifts with concealed power supply;</li>
                        <li>assistive call systems for staff support;</li>
                        <li>secondary entrances with compliant access;</li>
                        <li>procedural solutions integrated into operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Accessibility is still achievable with the right technical approach.</p>

                    <h2>4. Documentation and approvals</h2>
                    <p>Accessibility is checked by authorities. Documentation must include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>scaled drawings with compliant routes;</li>
                        <li>technical specs for ramps and lifts;</li>
                        <li>photoinsertions where heritage impact is relevant;</li>
                        <li>maintenance and safety plans.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Clear documentation prevents permit delays.</p>

                    <h2>5. Business impact</h2>
                    <p>Accessibility expands your market and reduces risk. Benefits include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>legal compliance and reduced liability;</li>
                        <li>broader customer base (international standards matter);</li>
                        <li>improved brand perception in luxury retail;</li>
                        <li>higher resale value with compliant infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Accessibility is not a cost—it is a commercial asset.</p>
                    <p>In steep contexts, even compliant ramps can feel unsafe if surfaces are not designed correctly. We specify high‑grip finishes and include drainage details so water does not create slippery conditions during rainfall.</p>
                    <p>Accessibility inside the store is equally important. A compliant entry but narrow aisles defeats the objective. We review circulation widths, turning areas, and access to fitting rooms or checkout points.</p>
                    <p>When a lift is used, power supply and maintenance access must be guaranteed. A non‑functioning lift can be worse than no lift because it creates legal exposure and reputational damage.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we document accessibility in the operational manual so staff can assist correctly. This converts physical compliance into real customer experience.</p>
                    <p>We test compliance against real usage scenarios: wheelchair entry, stroller access, and luggage handling. Retail in Taormina is international; accessibility expectations are high and reviews reflect that.</p>
                    <p>Where slopes are tight, we integrate level platforms into entry design, creating “pause points” that satisfy code and improve usability. This prevents steep, uncomfortable ramps that fail in practice.</p>
                    <p>We also consider signage and lighting for accessibility routes. Clear visual cues reduce confusion and improve safety, particularly in evening operations.</p>
                    <p>We also account for temporary solutions during works, ensuring the site remains safe for pedestrians and compliant even before final installation.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we include a maintenance plan for ramps and lifts—if they fail, compliance fails. Regular checks are a small cost compared to legal exposure.</p>
                    <p>Including accessibility in early concept design avoids costly retrofits and protects the opening schedule.</p>
                    <p>We also coordinate with local authorities to ensure the solution meets both national standards and municipal guidelines.</p>
                    <p>That alignment reduces the risk of post‑approval objections.</p>
                    <p>It also supports long‑term compliance audits.</p>
