                    <div class="exec-summary">
                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Facade units are often prohibited in historic centers.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Hidden systems must be planned with layout, not added later.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Performance and maintenance drive real cost.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Air‑conditioning in Taormina’s historic center is constrained by heritage rules. External units on facades are often prohibited, and space for equipment is limited. The investor pain is clear: inadequate comfort reduces sales and guest satisfaction. The solution is a concealed system designed early, with proper load calculations and maintenance access.</p>

                    <h2>1. Heritage restrictions and placement strategy</h2>
                    <p>Placement must respect facade regulations. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>identify hidden zones (courtyards, roofs, service voids);</li>
                        <li>coordinate with heritage authorities on visibility;</li>
                        <li>use photoinsertions to demonstrate invisibility;</li>
                        <li>select materials for grilles that match historic finishes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Visibility drives approval speed.</p>

                    <h2>2. System selection and load calculation</h2>
                    <p>Hidden systems must still perform. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>accurate thermal load calculations;</li>
                        <li>VRF or ducted systems with slim profiles;</li>
                        <li>condensate management to avoid infiltration;</li>
                        <li>noise control for indoor comfort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Undersized systems hurt comfort and brand perception.</p>

                    <h2>3. Integration with layout and finishes</h2>
                    <p>HVAC should be part of the design, not an afterthought. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ceiling coordination to avoid height loss;</li>
                        <li>diffuser placement for draft‑free comfort;</li>
                        <li>access panels for maintenance;</li>
                        <li>coordination with lighting and acoustic systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Integration reduces rework and preserves aesthetics.</p>

                    <h2>4. Energy efficiency and operating costs</h2>
                    <p>Hidden systems can be efficient if designed correctly. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>zoned controls with occupancy sensors;</li>
                        <li>smart scheduling to reduce peak loads;</li>
                        <li>energy monitoring for cost control;</li>
                        <li>maintenance contracts for system stability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Energy cost is part of ROI, not just comfort.</p>

                    <h2>5. Approval and commissioning</h2>
                    <p>Final approval depends on documentation and commissioning. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>submit detailed 1:20 drawings of grilles and paths;</li>
                        <li>test noise levels after installation;</li>
                        <li>commission systems before opening;</li>
                        <li>document compliance for future inspections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Commissioning is what turns design into actual performance.</p>
                    <p>Hidden systems must be coordinated with noise requirements. In luxury retail or hospitality, even low mechanical noise can reduce perceived quality. We specify low‑noise equipment and vibration isolation as part of the design.</p>
                    <p>Humidity control is critical in Taormina’s summer climate. Without it, finishes degrade and guest comfort suffers. We therefore include dehumidification strategies in early design, not after complaints.</p>
                    <p>We also plan for maintenance access: if filters or coils are inaccessible, operators skip maintenance, leading to higher energy costs and system failures. Accessible design protects ROI.</p>
                    <p>Energy monitoring systems allow owners to track consumption and detect inefficiencies early. This is a direct cost‑control tool for high‑end operations.</p>
                    <p>A well‑designed hidden HVAC system protects both heritage value and operational margin.</p>
                    <p>We often use split systems only where facades are not visible; otherwise, we rely on ducted or VRF solutions. This hybrid approach balances cost with compliance.</p>
                    <p>Condensate routing is critical in historic interiors. Improper drainage leads to staining and damage to heritage finishes. We design dedicated drains and inspection points to prevent this.</p>
                    <p>We also integrate HVAC with occupancy patterns: zoning allows operators to reduce energy consumption during low traffic hours without compromising comfort.</p>
                    <p>We run seasonal performance tests to verify comfort in peak summer conditions. If the system cannot keep up, the brand suffers immediately.</p>
                    <p>We also coordinate with tenant fit‑out timelines so HVAC commissioning aligns with opening, not weeks after.</p>
                    <p>Documenting the final installation helps future inspections and protects the approval record.</p>
                    <p>We also coordinate condensate discharge with plumbing permits to avoid future compliance issues.</p>
                    <p>Seasonal commissioning ensures performance in peak summer conditions, not just at mild temperatures.</p>
                    <p>It also supports long‑term energy targets.</p>
                    <p>That protects the investment.</p>
                    <p>It also stabilizes operating costs.</p>
