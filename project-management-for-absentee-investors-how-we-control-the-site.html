                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Remote investors need daily control, not monthly updates.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Clear SAL and reporting prevent budget drift.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Local supervision is the cheapest risk reduction.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Absentee investors face one core risk: losing control of time and budget. In Taormina, where logistics and permits are complex, distance magnifies the problem. The solution is a structured project management system with daily site control, transparent reporting, and tight cost governance. This is not “nice to have”—it is the difference between a successful opening and a delayed, over‑budget project.</p>

                    <h2>1. Daily site presence and decision speed</h2>
                    <p>Remote decisions create delays. A local PM ensures immediate resolution. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>daily site inspections and issue resolution;</li>
                        <li>rapid approvals on materials and samples;</li>
                        <li>coordination across trades to prevent clashes;</li>
                        <li>enforcement of safety and quality standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Speed at site level is the most effective way to protect schedules.</p>

                    <h2>2. Transparent reporting and SAL control</h2>
                    <p>Investors need factual, not narrative, updates. A disciplined system includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>weekly photo reports with measurable progress;</li>
                        <li>SAL linked to verified quantities, not percentages;</li>
                        <li>budget variance tracking and early warning flags;</li>
                        <li>forecast updates based on real progress.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without this, cost drift becomes invisible until it’s too late.</p>

                    <h2>3. Procurement and supplier management</h2>
                    <p>Lead times kill timelines. Procurement must be planned centrally. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>lead‑time mapping for long‑delivery items;</li>
                        <li>supplier vetting with local references;</li>
                        <li>contract terms tied to delivery and quality;</li>
                        <li>buffer stock for critical items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Procurement discipline is a core ROI protection tool.</p>

                    <h2>4. Permit management and compliance</h2>
                    <p>Local regulations are complex. A PM must manage compliance in parallel with construction:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>tracking of approvals and renewal deadlines;</li>
                        <li>coordination with heritage authorities;</li>
                        <li>documentation management for inspections;</li>
                        <li>management of change requests with authorities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Compliance failures are the most expensive delays.</p>

                    <h2>5. Pre‑opening readiness</h2>
                    <p>Opening is a separate project phase. The PM ensures a controlled handover:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>final punch list and defect resolution;</li>
                        <li>systems commissioning and staff training;</li>
                        <li>handover documentation for operations;</li>
                        <li>soft‑opening testing to identify issues early.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pre‑opening control is what turns construction into revenue.</p>
                    <p>Risk management is also contractual. We structure contracts with measurable deliverables and clear penalties for delay. This protects investors who cannot monitor the site daily and ensures contractors stay aligned with the schedule.</p>
                    <p>Communication cadence matters. We establish a fixed weekly update with cost‑to‑complete, issues list, and decisions required. This avoids the “silent drift” that often happens when investors are remote.</p>
                    <p>We also build a change‑control protocol: any variation that affects budget or timeline is documented, priced, and approved before execution. This alone prevents a large portion of budget overruns.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we provide a digital archive of all approvals, test results, and certifications. This increases asset liquidity and simplifies future resale or refinancing.</p>
                    <p>Quality control is codified in checklists for each trade. This prevents “good enough” installations that later require costly rework, especially in high‑end finishes.</p>
                    <p>We also conduct supplier audits and material verification on delivery. Substitutions are a common source of degradation in luxury projects, and remote investors are the first to suffer from it.</p>
                    <p>We set decision thresholds: minor variations are handled locally, while budget‑impacting changes require investor approval. This keeps speed without losing control.</p>
                    <p>Weekly risk reviews keep the project proactive. We track permit risks, procurement delays, and weather impacts as part of the standard PM cycle.</p>
                    <p>Monthly executive summaries translate technical progress into business impact, allowing investors to make timely decisions without being on site.</p>
                    <p>We also align payment schedules with verified progress to maintain leverage and ensure quality delivery at each milestone.</p>
                    <p>This keeps accountability clear and decisions fast.</p>
