                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Facade preservation is non‑negotiable in heritage retail.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Interior modernization must respect structural and regulatory limits.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Detailed documentation speeds approvals and prevents stop‑work orders.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Renovating a heritage shop in Taormina is a balance between brand standards and strict preservation rules. The investor’s pain is clear: a beautiful concept that cannot be approved or executed. The solution is technical discipline—design the interior for modern retail performance while preserving the facade with compliant materials, details, and methods. This is how you open on time and protect the asset’s long‑term value.</p>

                    <h2>1. Heritage constraints on the facade</h2>
                    <p>The facade is usually protected. Any intervention must be reversible and visually compatible. Operational steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>survey of existing facade elements and materials;</li>
                        <li>selection of compatible finishes and colors;</li>
                        <li>detailing of frames, signage, and lighting in 1:20 scale;</li>
                        <li>submission of photo‑insertions for heritage approval.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A facade decision made without approval is a guaranteed delay.</p>

                    <h2>2. Interior modernization without structural risk</h2>
                    <p>Historic buildings have limits: walls, vaults, and floors cannot be altered freely. Key actions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>structural survey to identify load limits;</li>
                        <li>layout planning to avoid cutting heritage elements;</li>
                        <li>lightweight partitions instead of invasive demolition;</li>
                        <li>MEP integration through existing shafts and cavities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Modern retail must work within the building’s structural reality.</p>

                    <h2>3. Systems and lighting integration</h2>
                    <p>Retail performance depends on lighting and comfort. In heritage shops, systems must be discreet. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>hidden HVAC solutions without facade units;</li>
                        <li>lighting rails integrated into ceilings or beams;</li>
                        <li>acoustic treatments to reduce reverberation;</li>
                        <li>access points for maintenance without demolition.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Technical systems should support sales, not fight the heritage fabric.</p>

                    <h2>4. Permitting and documentation</h2>
                    <p>Heritage authorities require complete documentation. We prepare:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>technical reports explaining reversible interventions;</li>
                        <li>material samples and mock‑ups;</li>
                        <li>coherent drawings across architecture and MEP;</li>
                        <li>compliance with local retail regulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Complete documentation is the fastest path to approval.</p>

                    <h2>5. Budget and opening timeline</h2>
                    <p>Heritage renovations often exceed standard budgets. Control requires:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>detailed BOQ with heritage‑specific items;</li>
                        <li>logistics costs for ZTL access;</li>
                        <li>phased scheduling to align with tourism season;</li>
                        <li>contingency for approval delays.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Opening on time is a financial requirement, not a luxury.</p>
                    <p>We recommend a facade mock‑up on site. It lets the heritage office evaluate texture and reflectivity in real light conditions, which often accelerates approvals and reduces subjective debates. A small mock‑up costs little compared to a delayed opening.</p>
                    <p>Interior fit‑outs must also account for structural load limits. Marble counters, heavy shelving, or safes can overload historic floors. We therefore check load capacity early and specify lightweight substructures where needed.</p>
                    <p>Retail comfort requires HVAC and humidity control, but external condensers are often forbidden. We design concealed systems and plan maintenance access so the interior remains clean while the systems remain serviceable.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we align the schedule with seasonal sales. If a shop misses the summer window, it may lose an entire year of return. The planning therefore prioritizes approvals and facade works early, leaving internal finishes for late stages.</p>
                    <p>We also include acoustic performance where needed. In narrow streets, reflections can amplify noise inside the store. Adding discreet acoustic panels and soft finishes improves comfort without compromising the historic aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>Procurement planning is critical. Custom heritage‑compatible joinery and metalwork often require long lead times. Ordering late compresses the schedule and risks missing the seasonal opening window.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we define a maintenance protocol for the facade and entry elements. Regular cleaning and minor repairs preserve the historic look and prevent larger restoration costs later.</p>
                    <p>Coordinate with the local heritage office for onsite inspections: being prepared with samples and drawings reduces follow‑up requests and keeps the schedule intact.</p>
