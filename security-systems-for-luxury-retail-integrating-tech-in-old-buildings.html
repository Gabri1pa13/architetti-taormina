                    <div class="exec-summary">
                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Security is a financial requirement, not just technology.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Old buildings require discreet, integrated systems.</strong></li>
                        <li>👉 <strong>Insurance compliance drives technical specifications.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Luxury retail security must protect both assets and brand reputation. In old buildings, visibility is restricted and heritage constraints apply. The investor’s pain is clear: security that is either ineffective or visually damaging. The solution is an integrated system—glass protection, alarms, CCTV, and access control—designed to meet insurer requirements without compromising aesthetics.</p>

                    <h2>1. Risk assessment and insurer requirements</h2>
                    <p>Security design starts with risk classification. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>define product value and exposure risk;</li>
                        <li>review insurer specifications for glazing and alarms;</li>
                        <li>define required resistance classes (e.g., P6B);</li>
                        <li>set response and monitoring protocols.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without insurer alignment, the system may be rejected.</p>

                    <h2>2. Glass protection and facade integration</h2>
                    <p>Facade solutions must be strong but discreet. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>reinforced glazing with compatible frames;</li>
                        <li>hidden fixings to preserve heritage appearance;</li>
                        <li>structural checks for added weight;</li>
                        <li>integration with shading or display systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Security must be invisible to customers but effective for insurers.</p>

                    <h2>3. CCTV and intrusion systems</h2>
                    <p>Technology must integrate without visual clutter. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>camera placement to avoid blind spots;</li>
                        <li>storage systems compliant with privacy rules;</li>
                        <li>motion detection and perimeter alarms;</li>
                        <li>backup power for critical components.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Systems should reduce risk, not create operational hassle.</p>

                    <h2>4. Access control and staff protocols</h2>
                    <p>Security is also procedural. Actions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>access logs for staff and suppliers;</li>
                        <li>secure storage for high‑value items;</li>
                        <li>opening/closing checklists;</li>
                        <li>training for emergency response.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Procedures protect the investment as much as hardware.</p>

                    <h2>5. Maintenance and long‑term compliance</h2>
                    <p>Security systems degrade without maintenance. Steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>scheduled system testing and calibration;</li>
                        <li>replacement of cameras and sensors on cycles;</li>
                        <li>annual insurer compliance checks;</li>
                        <li>updates for software vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Maintenance preserves both security and insurability.</p>
                    <p>In heritage buildings, routing cables is often the biggest challenge. We plan cable paths early, using existing shafts and minimizing surface conduits to preserve visual integrity.</p>
                    <p>We also integrate security with store design: display layouts, lighting, and sightlines reduce theft risk without making the space feel defensive. This preserves the luxury atmosphere while improving protection.</p>
                    <p>Coordination with insurers is essential. A system that does not meet insurer specifications can invalidate coverage. We obtain written confirmation before procurement to avoid costly rework.</p>
                    <p>Finally, cyber‑security matters: remote monitoring systems must be protected against breaches, especially when linked to cloud services. This is an often overlooked but critical risk.</p>
                    <p>We also plan for customer privacy. Luxury clients expect discretion; overly visible cameras or barriers can undermine the experience. The goal is to protect assets without compromising ambience.</p>
                    <p>Integration with POS and inventory systems allows real‑time stock monitoring. This reduces shrinkage and helps the brand manage high‑value items securely.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we require service contracts with guaranteed response times. A failed alarm or camera during peak season is a business risk, not just a technical issue.</p>
                    <p>We design silent alarm protocols aligned with local police response times. A fast response is part of the security equation, not just the hardware.</p>
                    <p>Where vaults are required, we verify structural capacity and access paths early. Installing heavy vaults in historic buildings can require reinforcement and permits that must be scheduled in advance.</p>
                    <p>We also integrate panic buttons and staff training for high‑value client interactions. Human factors are as critical as technology in luxury environments.</p>
                    <p>We also ensure CCTV coverage of cash handling zones to reduce internal risk without altering customer experience.</p>
                    <p>Periodic penetration tests of networked systems are recommended to ensure long‑term cyber resilience.</p>
                    <p>Documentation of tests and maintenance keeps insurers aligned year after year.</p>
